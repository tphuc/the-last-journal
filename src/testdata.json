			"content": "<p><strong>A WORD FROM JOHN F KENNEDY</strong></p><p><em>\"The very word \"secrecy\" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.</em></p><p><em>For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</em></p><p><em>Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.</em></p><p><em>No President should fear public scrutiny of his program. For from that scrutiny comes understanding; and from that understanding comes support or opposition. And both are necessary. I am not asking your newspapers to support the Administration, but I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people. For I have complete confidence in the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully informed.\"</em><em>&nbsp;- </em>President John F. Kennedy,&nbsp;American Newspaper Publishers Association on 27th April 1961</p><p>I will leave it up to you to come to your own conclusion as to what this speech is about. But&nbsp;his details and his thoughts on secret societies and what seems to be a call to action. What or who is the secret society did JFK mention about&nbsp;?&nbsp;Did he tried to warn us about something?&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/american-newspaper-publishers-association-19610427\">https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/american-newspaper-publishers-association-19610427</a></em></p><p>The death of JFK's full story still remains mystery until today. Seven days before president J.F.K was assassinated he was reported to have said the following:\n\"There is a plot in this country to enslave every man, woman and child. Before I leave this high and noble office, I intend to expose this plot.\"&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/american-newspaper-publishers-association-19610427\"></a></p>"

The objective was to purchase control and influence many major media outlets.&nbsp;The CIA also planned to have many reporters and journalists on the CIA payroll – a practice many people believe is continuing to this day... &nbsp;One of the main objectives was to use these journalists as spies and to spread propaganda. However its ultimate goal is to control what the public think, to&nbsp;paint the narratives that push political agenda. The list of news organizations came to include reporters from ABC, NBC, CBS, Time, Newsweek, Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, and Copley News Service.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_influence_on_public_opinion\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_influence_on_public_opinion</a></p>",
