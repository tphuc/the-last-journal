			"content": "<p><em>\"The very word \"secrecy\" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.</em></p><p><em>For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</em></p><p><em>Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.</em></p><p><em>No President should fear public scrutiny of his program. For from that scrutiny comes understanding; and from that understanding comes support or opposition. And both are necessary. I am not asking your newspapers to support the Administration, but I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people. For I have complete confidence in the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully informed.\"</em></p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/american-newspaper-publishers-association-19610427\">https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/american-newspaper-publishers-association-19610427</a></em></p><p>This text was extracted from the speech THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRESS, by president John F Kennedy on 27th&nbsp;April,&nbsp;1961.&nbsp; JFK was later assassinated on November 22, 1963. The death of JFK's full story still remains hidden util today. Seven days before president J.F.K was assassinated he was reported to have said the following:\n\"There is a plot in this country to enslave every man, woman and child. Before I leave this high and noble office, I intend to expose this plot.\"</p><p>What could he have meant? Did he tried to warn us about something? If he intended to expose it, this means it is something hidden, like a shadow government.&nbsp;\nAmerica is indeed run by secret societies. In fact the world is and has been controlled by selected group of people  for millennia (the Cabal ,&nbsp;the Deep State, or the Illuminati whatever you call it). The dead of JFK also was involved by the CIA (that will be cover in later posts).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/american-newspaper-publishers-association-19610427\"></a></p>"

			"content": "<p><strong>The CIA's plan to infiltrate the media</strong></p><p>Operation Mockingbird is an alleged large-scale program of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that began in the early years of the Cold War and attempted to manipulate news media for propaganda purposes.\nWhen the Cold War was getting started in the late 1940’s, the CIA implemented a program called Operation Mockingbird. The objective was to purchase control and influence many major media outlets, infiltrated into every branch of big newspaper and the media.&nbsp; The CIA also planned to have many reporters and journalists on the CIA payroll – a practice many people believe is continuing to this day... &nbsp;One of the main objectives was to use these journalists as spies and to spread propaganda. However its ultimate goal is to control what the public think, to create or paint the narratives that push their agenda. The list of news organizations came to include reporters from ABC, NBC, CBS, Time, Newsweek, Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, and Copley News Service.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_influence_on_public_opinion\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_influence_on_public_opinion</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird</a></p>"
